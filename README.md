# ExposeMusic
<h2>Overview</h2>
Spotify has a yearly recap where they use the data from their users and report the users favorite song, genre, playlist, etc... This app will be using the Spotify API and React JS to give spotify users the power to search some of their favorite songs, genre, playlist and more from the day they searched it. The user will first need to login to their Spotify so that access these catagories using the Spotify API. Our App will also be able to recommend new music or playlists using the users data and what they generally like to listen to. I really feel like one thing Spotify missed was letting their users be able to share all the recaps and letting their friends or others see what their most heard song was from the past year
